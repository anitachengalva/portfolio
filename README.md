# Portfolio

    live deployed link: https://anitachengalva.github.io/portfolio/

In this project, I worked in HTML and CSS.
Within CSS, flexbox has been incredibly useful in formatting my page layouts.

This portfolio is a webpage with a vertical, left-side navigation bar.
It provides convenient access to my bio, resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, examples of my work, & contact info all in one place.
